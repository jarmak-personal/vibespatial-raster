# Commit — Full Landing Flow

You are landing work. Follow these steps exactly in order. Do not skip any
step. Do not create a git commit without completing the review.

## Step 1: Run /pre-land-review

Invoke the `pre-land-review` skill. This runs:
- All deterministic checks (ruff, zero-copy compliance)
- AI-powered sub-agent reviews (GPU code review, zero-copy enforcer,
  performance analysis, maintainability enforcer) as applicable

If the review finds BLOCKING issues, **stop here**. Fix them and re-run
`/commit`. Do not proceed to Step 2 with blocking findings.

## Step 2: Stage changes

After the review passes with verdict LAND:

1. Run `git status` to see what needs staging.
2. Run `git diff --cached --name-only` to see what is already staged.
3. Stage the appropriate files. Prefer staging specific files by name over
   `git add -A`. Never stage `.env`, credentials, or large binaries.
4. If the user specified which files to commit, stage only those.

## Step 3: Write the review marker

The `commit-msg` hook (if present) requires a content-addressable review
marker. Write it:

```bash
printf '{\n  "timestamp": "%s",\n  "staged_hash": "%s",\n  "files": [%s],\n  "verdict": "LAND"\n}\n' \
  "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  "$(git diff --cached | sha256sum | cut -d' ' -f1)" \
  "$(git diff --cached --name-only | sed 's/.*/"&"/' | paste -sd,)" \
  > .claude/.review-completed
```

**IMPORTANT**: If you stage any additional files AFTER writing the marker,
the hash will no longer match. Always write the marker as the LAST step
before `git commit`.

## Step 4: Create the commit

1. Analyze the staged diff to draft a concise commit message.
2. If the user provided `$ARGUMENTS`, use that as the commit message (or
   incorporate it).
3. Create the commit using a HEREDOC for proper formatting:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<commit message here>

Co-Authored-By: Claude <co-author tag>
EOF
)"
```

4. Run `git status` after the commit to verify success.

## Step 5: Report

Tell the user the commit was created. Show the commit hash and summary.

## Rules

- NEVER skip the pre-land review.
- NEVER use `--no-verify` or `-n` flags. The pre-land-gate hook blocks these.
- If the pre-commit hook fails (ruff, zero-copy, etc.), fix the issues and
  retry. Do NOT amend — create a new commit.
- The review marker is single-use: deleted after a successful commit.
- If the commit fails for any reason, re-run `/commit` from the top.

## Review Enforcement — Zero Tolerance

These rules govern how you handle findings from the pre-land review. They
are NON-NEGOTIABLE.

### NEVER reclassify BLOCKING as NIT

If a sub-agent flags something as BLOCKING, it stays BLOCKING. You do not
have authority to downgrade it. The only valid NIT is a known codebase-wide
gap that requires a coordinated migration — not "it works fine" or "it's
minor". When in doubt, it is BLOCKING.

### NEVER excuse new debt with existing debt

"Other functions don't do this either" is not a justification. Every new
line of code must meet the standard. If existing code has a shortcoming,
your new code must not compound that problem by building on it. Instead:

- If the fix is small (< 5 minutes): fix the upstream function too.
- If the fix is structural: spawn a `cuda-engineer` agent with the context
  needed to fix the upstream API, then build your code against the fixed
  version.

The goal is to shrink the cleanup backlog, not grow it.

### NEVER accept CPU work in GPU code paths

If a review finds host round-trips (D->H->D), CPU fallbacks, or numpy
calls inside a GPU-dispatched function, this is ALWAYS BLOCKING. Common
excuses that are NOT valid:

- "The upstream API returns host arrays" — Fix the upstream API or spawn
  a cuda-engineer agent to do so.
- "It's just one small transfer" — Small transfers have large latency.
  Every D->H->D is a pipeline stall. Fix it.
- "We'll clean it up later" — No. Later never comes.

### What to do when a finding requires upstream fixes

Do NOT mark the review as LAND and leave a TODO. Instead:

1. Spawn a `cuda-engineer` agent (background, worktree) with:
   - The specific function/API that needs fixing
   - What it currently returns (e.g., host array)
   - What it should return (e.g., device array)
   - The downstream code that needs it
2. Wait for or incorporate the fix.
3. Re-run `/commit` against the complete change.
